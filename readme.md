# 🐍 Snake → Food Game

A classic **Snake game** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** as a learning project.  
This project helped me understand game loops, DOM manipulation, event handling, and core game logic by building something fun and interactive.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Using `requestAnimationFrame` for a game loop  
- Managing game state (snake, food, direction, score)  
- Implementing collision detection  
- Rendering with CSS Grid + DOM updates  
- Handling keyboard, pointer & touch events  
- Using `localStorage` for data persistence  
- Structuring a small project cleanly

## 🚧 Status

The game is fully playable and stable.  
I may continue improving UI, controls, and add small features as I keep learning.

## 🙌 Purpose

This project is part of my learning journey to strengthen my **JavaScript fundamentals** by building something practical instead of just solving isolated problems.
